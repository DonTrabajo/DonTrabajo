# Felix Gutierrez  
🔹 Offensive Security | AI-Augmented Recon | Builder of Tools & Beats  
🧠 aka **Prox** | 🎭 aka **Don Trabajo**

Hi, I’m Felix — a red team recon specialist, ethical hacker, and lifelong creative.

As **Prox**, I focus on real-world offensive security: building tools, auditing attack surfaces, and integrating AI workflows into practical InfoSec ops. My current work includes the [Prox Offensive Recon Toolkit](https://recon.proxoffensive.com), custom GPT assistants, and OSINT enrichment pipelines.

As **Don Trabajo**, I’m a musician and storyteller, blending Afro-Latin roots, brujería mysticism, and Bronx-born rhythm into sound. The same spirit that drives my music fuels my hacking — pattern recognition, improvisation, and flow.

I created **Prox Offensive Information Security** to bring these worlds together — where code meets culture, and creativity meets discipline.
