# Don Trabajo
Building public-safe offensive tooling with enforceable OPSEC gates; advanced orchestration and lab workflows remain private by design.

## Start here
- [DonTrabajoGPT-Core](https://github.com/DonTrabajo/DonTrabajoGPT-Core) - public recon core (linPEAS parsing + CVE matching) with CI-enforced OPSEC gates
- [ProxMesh-Blueprint](https://github.com/DonTrabajo/ProxMesh-Blueprint) - public blueprint of a local-first multi-agent security lab (demo + OPSEC gates)
- [ProxReconToolkit](https://github.com/DonTrabajo/ProxReconToolkit) - client-facing recon starter + sample audit (public-safe)
- [apt33-scythe-case-study](https://github.com/DonTrabajo/apt33-scythe-case-study) - APT33 emulation case study with detections, hunting queries, and results/tuning notes

## What I do
- AI-augmented recon and reporting tooling
- Emulation planning and detection engineering
- OPSEC-first publication practices (scans + CI gates)
- Client-facing reporting artifacts
- Clear, reproducible public demos

## Public vs private
- Public repos contain demos, blueprints, and detection-focused writeups; sanitized and CI-gated.
- Private repos contain operational workflows, lab bindings, and environment-specific automation.
